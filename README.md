# Craig Engine
This is a chess engine program that I have been working on for a while in a competition with a friend. It implements the [UCI interface](https://gist.github.com/DOBRO/2592c6dad754ba67e6dcaec8c90165bf) and can be used with most chess GUIs.

## Features
- Bitboard representation
- Move generation
- Move pruning and Sorting
- Evaluation function
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Position Hashing
- Transposition
  
## Installation
The engine should work both on UNIX and Windows systems. The project is built by running make release in the base directory, and it should produce executables for all platforms.
